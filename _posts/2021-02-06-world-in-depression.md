## Introduction

### Two opposing views

* Milton Friedman — the cause of the GD was the monetary policy in the US; neglects Europe and the periphery, and also other real factors
* Paul Samuelson — GD happened because of a seried of historical accidents; but GD was different than 1873 - 1896 depression, so the GD was in fact unique

### "Great Depression" before The Great Depression in 1930s — 1873-1896

* Orgin of the depression was in the "profound unsettlement of short-term money markets", arising from a withdrawal of 90m pounds from London in 12 months — German indemnity of the Franco-Prussian War 1872 — J. Newbold (1932), The Beginning of the World Crisis 1873 - 1896
* See also, Bagehot, Lombard Street p. 291

### Uniformities of (Great?) Depressions

* Napoleonic wars were followed by a short, sharp deflation in 1816 → restoration of the pound to par → foreign lending → crash and depression in 1826
* The Panic of 1837 maybe was a bit different but...
* Depression of 1848 has more parallels
	* British view - railwaymania and other real factors like wheat crops
	* Continental view - financial and banking crisis

**For some reason the economic system failed**: both microeconomic adjustments of supply and demand, and macroeconomic fiscal and monetary policies.

1. Economic Illiteracy on the policy level
	* Many deflationists (Hoover, Bruning, Snowden, Laval)
	* British decision to return to the gold standard at par in 1925
	* Roosevelt-Morgenthau-Warren attempt to raise the price of gold
	* Blum experiment with 40 hour week in France
	* Too little and too late loans
	* Transfer problem — Roosevelt and Hoover wanted to cancel the debt but the American public didn't want to, (Robert H. Feller (1957), American Diplomacy and the Great Depression)
	* Tariffs — Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act
2. Failure of monetary adjustment mechanism
	* According to Lionel Robbinson the Gold Standard itself wasn't to blame for the GD but the way it was operated — Lionel Robbinson (1934), The Great Depression
3. International capital flow mechanisms also failed
	- If the capital flows stop, then it may deflationary for the importing country, and expansionary for those who stop sending savings abroad
	- Imposition of tariffs should be expansionary for the importing country, if it is contractive for the countries losing export
	- If the prices of internationally traded commodities fall, then the income and spending of countries specialized in these goods also fall. But the income of countries which regularly buy these commodities should rise 

***So while currency appreciation is deflationary, the opposite forces should create expansions in other regions. The world depression, thus, cannot be explained by monetary factors without specifying why the other side of the leverage did not work. Why the asymmetry was possible?***

Symmetric system: Advancing his own welfare, advances that of a total — Adam Smith

- Although a world system with few actors (countries) is not like this and the *fallacy of composition* enters to affect the outcome
- In advancing its own by economic good by tariff, currency depreciation, foreign-exchange control a country worsens the welfare of its partners, which can lead to retaliation so that the whole ends up worsening the welfare in total i.e. beggar-thy neighbor

**Reparations and debt repayment problem as well as trade tariffs show no strong leadership in the interwar period, no country sets the rules, standards of conduct for others to follow, no country takes on an undue share of burden of the system** – maintaining a flow of investment capital, discounting its paper, accepting its redundant commodities

* Britain played that role in until 1913
* Inability of the British to continue their role of underwriter to the system and reluctance of US to take it was a significant part of the reason for length and depth of the depression. 

## Recovery from the First World War

### 1919 - 1920

* Asymmetry: price and wage increases in the manufacturing sector, and contraction, stubborn resistance of prices and wages and unemployment
	* most visible in Britain and Germany
* Rise in price of capital assets
* Why reparation after Napoleonic Wars were successfully transferred and those of WW1 not? –> see C. P. Kindleberger (1968), International Economics pp. 326-9

### 1922 occupation of Ruhr

* Did not help, workers resisted and sabotaged output, there was also violence, French squad killed 13 workers, including 5 teenagers
* Ruhr was "the most effective and direct cause of Hitler, and but for this there would have been no Second World War" — Grigg, Prejudice and Judgment p. 160

### Reparations

* **Hyperinflation** in Germany was a important cause of the depth of the GD because of the fear of the inflation in 1930s → no monetary or fiscal expansion possible
* Reparations [...] together with war debts complicated and corrupted the the international economy at every stage of the 1920s and during the depression through to 15 June 1933, three days after the opening of the World Economic Conference
* Reparations Commission — 132,000 million gold marks; Keynes proposed $10,000 million
* Dawes loan $110 million, overwritten by Morgan, oversubscribed 10 times
* British were willing to cancel reparations/war debts if they debts to US were canceled
* **French wanted the reparations badly**, they paid twice in 1800s reparations, once to Germany once to Britain; now was their turn to receive payments, and on top of that they had debt obligations to pay to Britain and the US
* Detailed account on reparations and debt payments: Moulton and Pasvolsky (1932), War Debts and World Prosperity p. 82,115
* **US applied pressure to collect the debts on other countries by denying an access to the New York capital market**
* Loan to French in November 1924, just after obtaining a loan from Morgan in March same year
* Stabilization of pound in 1932 (?)

### The difference between functioning of foreign bond markets in New York and London

* Britain:
	* Foreign lending and domestic investment were substitutes (stable)
	* Except business cycle turning points where lending moved together with the changes to the interest rate
	* British lending followed a supply model (fixed supply)
* United States:
	* Foreign and domestic lending positively correlated with cyclical movement of profits and interest rates
	* Except turning points
	* US lending followed closely the business cycle

### The Boom

* **US: the boom wasn't that spectacular at all, except the stock market**
* Pressure on real resources was moderate
* Unemployment 3.1%
* Wages increased only 5% from 1925 to 1919
* Rise 5% in farm products
* Fall 8% in commodities
* Industrial production in 1929 was 175% of what is was in 1913 in the US; in Germany 110%; but if we look at the period from 1924 then the production was growing faster in Germany
* In France industrial production peaked in the first half of 1930 and didn't slow down until the second half of 1931, not 1929
* Also, French budget (1929) ran large surpluses, security prices doubled after currency stabilization
* 1922 Genoa conference, problem: deficient gold supply — gold-exchange system

### The end of the discount rate

* Germany accumulated some sterling reserves by a British part of the Dawes plan

* In 1926 there was an excessive inflow of foreign capital and Schacht didn't want the inflow to continue but also didn't want to expand domestically by lowering the discount rate, so he bought gold with the Reichsbank sterling reserves

* Britain, to stop an outflow gold, would have to raise the bank rate, but it didn't want to. The unemployment in Britain was already high and thus it would make it even worse. Then the political unrest would follow.

* Then Britain just let gold leave its reserves

* After stabilization of franc the French obtained a lot of foreign reserves which they then were converting to gold

* Norman asked the French to declare the franc legally stabilized to stop excessive, speculative capital flows from Britan to France, and the BOE gold drain and Moreau asked British to raise the interest rates obtain the same result

* July 1927, in the home of the US Secretary of Treasury Ogden Mills on Long Island there was a meeting between Norman, Strong, Schacht and Rist (Moreau's man)

* They agreed to lower the interest rate in the US to help London and Berlin with their gold reserves

* Since 1927 France was in fact able to push Britain off the gold standard but they didn't do that

* Moreau's diary reveals that the French sterling reserves could be used as a mean to pressure The Bank of England on dividing the Europe on two spheres of financial influence

### July 1927: FED purchased $200m of securities in OMO and lowered the interest rate to 3.5%

* Why?:
	* 1927 recession
	* falling commodity prices
	* assistance to Britain in keeping their gold reserves at bay
	
* Did it contribute to the GD?
	* Friedman, Schwartz: maybe a little bit but not as much as the FED policies later on during the crisis
	* Galbraith: no
	
### Decline in foreign lending (1928)
