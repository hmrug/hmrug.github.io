Hi there!

[//]: <> (This is also a comment.)

I'm Hubert Mrugala, pursue a master's degree in finance at University of Zurich.

Here, on this blog, you're most likely to see my thoughts on (history of) international monetary system, international economics, business cycles, financial markets and philosophy. Since it's just a regular personal blog, you may also see some post that don't pertain to any of the mentioned topics (category: misc). I also share some of my book notes (category: books) that I take to systematize and deepen my own understanding.

If you're interested in global banking and money markets, please check out the other project that I founded, where we break down the modern monetary system
